# GettingStartedWithJavaBasics

I have made many attempts to start and actually complete this course. I made this course and specifically this repository to track my progress in the way of learning Java based technologies. Here I am starting afresh right from the beginning of the complex journey of learning Java.

The code inside is made as if two people are conversing, one asking the questions, and another answering them. Idea behind doing this is to create a sense of knowledge sharing from a beginners point of view.
